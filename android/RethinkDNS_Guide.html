<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>HTTP</strong> (HyperText Transfer Protocol): The standard protocol used by web
browsers and servers to transfer web pages and related resources over the
internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP</strong> (Internet Protocol): The address system of the internet that routes
data packets from source to destination devices. IP operates at the network
layer and does not guarantee delivery order or error checking, which is
handled by TCP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Address</strong> (Internet Protocol Address): A unique numeric label assigned to
each device on a network, used to identify and locate the device for
communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnet</strong> (Subnet Range): represents a block of IP addresses grouped together
under a single rule. Instead of allowing or blocking individual IP addresses
one by one, you define a subnet to include a wide range of IPs within that
block.(Useful for apps that you <code>Isolate</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host</strong>: Any device connected to a network with an IP address, capable of
sending and receiving data, including computers, phones, or servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Client</strong>: A device or software (often your computer or phone) that initiates
requests to servers to access resources or services, forming the client-server
model of communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port</strong>: A port in networking is a virtual communication endpoint managed by
a computer's operating system that helps direct network traffic to specific
apps or services. While an IP address identifies a device on a network, ports
allow the system to know exactly which app or service should handle the
incoming or outgoing data. Web traffic commonly uses port 80 (HTTP) or 443
(HTTPS), so when data arrives for those ports, it's routed to the web server
application on the device. When we block port 80, we block insecure HTTP
connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) is responsible for maintaining a
connection through a handshake and putting the packets in the correct order.
TCP will also ask for missing pieces and is known as a reliable but slow
protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UDP</strong> (User Datagram Protocol) (UDP/IP): is a fast protocol used across the
internet for time-sensitive transmissions such as DNS lookups or VoIP. UDP
allows a computer to send data straight to another without requiring a
handshake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS</strong> (Domain Name System): stores domain information in a distributed
database and translates domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. This
enables us to only have to remember simple domain names rather than complex IP
addresses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Domain Name</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">ssd.eff.org
 |   |   |
 |   |  top-level domain
 |   |
 |   second-level domain
 |
subdomain
</code></pre>
<p>‚òùÔ∏è The hierarchy is read from right to left, the TLD is the highest-level
domain (<code>.org</code> here), the second-level domain (<code>eff</code>) is directly to the left
of the TLD, and anything further left (like <code>ssd</code>) is a subdomain under that
second-level domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Server</strong>: When you search for a domain name (rethinkdns.com) it triggers
a DNS lookup. Several different types of DNS servers typically work together
to complete a single DNS lookup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Resolver</strong>: is a server or software component that translates domain
names into IP addresses that devices use to communicate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recursive resolver</strong> (DNS recursor): is typically the first stop in the
series of the above servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Iterative resolver</strong>: In an iterative DNS query, each DNS server responds
directly to the client with a referral to another server, and the client
continues querying successive servers until it receives the IP address for the
requested domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proxy</strong>: A proxy, in relation to Orbot with Rethink, is an intermediary
service that routes internet traffic from your device through the Tor network
to provide privacy and anonymity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTTP(S) Proxy</strong>: An HTTP proxy is an intermediary server that forwards
HTTP/HTTPS web traffic from a client (e.g., a browser or app) to destination
servers, allowing for privacy, filtering, or routing control while masking the
user's IP. HTTP proxies only work with web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SOCKS5</strong> (Socket Secure 5): Is an internet proxy protocol that transfers
info from one server to another while redirecting the user's IP address. It
supports both UDP and TCP and can actually improve speed in some cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole">pi-hole</a>: a DNS sinkhole that protects
your devices content without installing any client-side software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch">OpenSnitch</a>: is a GNU/Linux
application firewall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>proxifier</em>: a proxifier acts as a proxy client, routing specific application
traffic through proxy servers without encrypting data or providing global IP
masking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>VPN</em> (Virtual Private Network): a VPN creates an encrypted tunnel that routes
all network traffic from your device through a remote server, masking your IP
address and securing your entire connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WireGuard: a modern VPN encryption protocol, its fast and has gained
widespread adoption among VPN providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenVPN: an older, more mature VPN protocol that uses SSL/TLS for encryption.
It's known for being very reliable and highly configurable but tends to be
slower and more complex than WireGuard. Good VPNs often give you the choice
between protocols.</p>

<p><code>Bypass DNS and Firewall</code>: Bypass the DNS and Firewall for this app, <strong>this

<p>The DNS mode routes all DNS traffic generated by all apps to <strong>any</strong> user chosen
DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, DNSCrypt, or Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS resolver.</p>
<p>Firewalls like Rethink that block both UDP and TCP connections are usually
sufficient because nearly all applications rely on these two protocols for their
networking and communication. Almost every app communicates over TCP or UDP, so
blocking these protocols effectively restricts most network traffic from and to
apps, preventing them from connecting without permission.</p>
<p>I will share how I use RethinkDNS, obviously feel free to make changes based on
your threat model and needs.</p>
<p>Different versions of the RethinkDNS have different features and capabilities.
The best version in my opinion is the F-Droid version.</p>

<p>Throughout this article, I'll be discussing the <strong>RethinkDNS Android App</strong>.
We'll later reference the <strong>DNS Blocklist configuring website</strong>, which is
available at <a href="https://rethinkdns.com/configure">rethinkdns.com/configure</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ùó NOTE: When you switch to an encrypted DNS resolver, you are shifting your
trust from your ISP's DNS servers to the third-party DNS provider you choose.
Encryption protects your DNS queries from being seen or intercepted by
outsiders, like your ISP or network eavesdroppers, which improves privacy.
However, the DNS resolver itself still sees all your queries and could
potentially log, analyze, or misuse that data.</p>

<p>That said, it's quite common for ISPs to engage in practices that compromise
user privacy. Do some research, whats their business model, privacy policy, etc.
Unfortunately, with a VPN you are also just shifting the trust. Don't blindly
choose a VPN either, I haven't found a free VPN that I would trust...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cyberinsider.com/internet-service-providers-isp-privacy-data-collection/">ISP data-collection</a></li>
</ul>
<p><code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; Other DNS</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose the type of resolver you want, I use DNSCrypt. Once you click you can
choose the specific resolver you want such as Quad9. You may notice that it
says <code>Failed: using fallback DNS</code>. This is only because we haven't turned it
on yet, we will recheck this once we turn it on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want a relay in a specific country, you can click the <code>Relays</code> tab. For
DNSCrypt you are given the choice between the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Los
Angeles, and Singapore. You might do this if you were trying to circumvent
censorship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules</strong> set the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Advanced DNS filtering (experimental)</code>: Assign unique IP per DNS request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Prompt on blocklist updates</code>: This is for if you use Rethink's custom
blocklists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Prevent DNS leaks</code>: When enabled, Rethink captures all packets on port 53 and
forwards it to a user-set DNS endpoint.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Leave all the <code>Advanced</code> defaults unless you plan on setting up a SOCKS5 proxy,
in which case you will want to enable <code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; Never proxy DNS</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>F-Droid Specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Split DNS (experimental)</code>: Forward DNS queries from proxied apps to the
proxy's DNS servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Treat DNS rules as firewall rules (experimental)</code>: DNS blocking will be
bypassed during resolution; the decision will be made at connection time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set <code>Use fallback DNS as bypass</code>: where it always uses your fallback DNS for
bypassed apps, domains and IPs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also set <code>Use System DNS for undelgated domains</code> which is generally
safe to enable and useful if access to local network devices or custom
internal domains is needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Blocklists</strong>:</p>
<p>This is a cool feature, similar to NextDNS if I understand correctly. Since it's
a system-wide DNS filter it applys to any app that is run through Rethink, not
only your browser, <strong>every app</strong>.</p>
<p>Blocklists are available when you use Rethink's DNS.</p>
<p><code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; Rethink DNS</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose between <code>Sky</code> with higher uptime and a stub resolver at cloudflare.com,
OR <code>Max</code> which is more private and has its recursive resolver at fly.io.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose between the preconfigured blocklists, OR Click <code>RDNS Plus</code>, <code>EDIT</code>,
<code>ADVANCED</code>, Search blocklists: <code>hagezi</code>, <code>Multi Pro++ (HaGeZi)</code>,
<code>APPLY (RDNS PLUS)</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can manually Check for an update to the blocklists, which you should
because they are updated regularly with new identified threats. You can also
enable <code>Prompt on blocklist update</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/wiki/FAQ#sources">hagezi which version should I use?</a></p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>F-Droid &amp; Github Versions</strong></p>
<p>When on the F-Droid and GitHub versions of the Rethink, you can download
blocklists from <code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; On-device blocklists</code>, and have them setup
for <strong>any</strong> DNS upstream.</p>
<p>There is a known bug where it sometimes when you click <code>DOWNLOAD BLOCKLISTS</code> it
just keeps listening and never receives anything. The GitHub <code>v05.5n</code> that I'm
using was affected by this with the Obtainium App.</p>
<p>This <strong>does work</strong> on the F-Droid version.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to use ODoH with the HAGEZI Blocklist you could:</p>
<p>Go to <code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; Other DNS</code>, Choose <code>ODoH</code> with <code>Cloudflare</code>. Start
it.</p>
<p>Now in <code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; RULES</code>, tap <code>On-device blocklists</code>, and click the
disabled logo, then click <code>DOWNLOAD BLOCKLISTS</code>. Once the download is complete,
you can select <code>Configure</code> and select <code>ADVANCED</code> and search for HAGEZI, choose
MULTI PRO++ and maybe oisd small, then press <code>APPLY (ON-DEVICE)</code>.</p>
<p>Now any app that doesn't bypass Rethink will use your chosen blocklists, denying
access to malicious URLs.</p>
<p>The HAGEZI blocklists are respected for being updated frequently. There are
different levels with MULTI PRO++ (HAGEZI) being the highest and 4 other lest
strict levels.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="network"><a class="header" href="#network">Network</a></h3>
<p>Settings explained:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Loopback proxy forwarder apps</strong>: Enable when you want all of your devices
proxy-related traffic to also flow through Rethinks encrypted tunnel. It
ensures apps that proxy DNS/HTTP/SOCKS traffic don't leak outside the VPN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not route Private IPs</strong>: Prevents routing traffic destined for private IP
address ranges (like 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) through the tunnel. Instead, this
traffic goes directly over the local network or system default route. Most
useful when you want devices on your local network (NAS, printers, etc.) to be
reachable by apps on your phone without routing the traffic through Rethinks
tunnel, improving performance and reliability of local connections but
possibly reducing privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loopback (experimental)</strong>: When enabled, this routes RethinkDNS's own
internal traffic, such as blocklist downloads, connectivity checks, and DNS
queries made by the app itself, back into the encrypted tunnel through the
loopback device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Setting</th><th>Function</th><th>When to Use</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Loopback Proxy Forwarder Apps</td><td>Route proxy-forwarder app traffic back into Rethink VPN tunnel</td><td>When you want consistent VPN/privacy coverage for proxies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Do Not Route Private IPs</td><td>Avoid routing local network/private IP traffic through VPN (send directly)</td><td>To access local devices without VPN bottlenecks</td></tr>
<tr><td>Loopback (Experimental)</td><td>Route Rethink‚Äôs own app traffic (updates/checks) back through VPN tunnel</td><td>To fully protect app's own DNS/blocklist traffic</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>NOTE: The above settings are disabled by default because some are experimental
and can easily break functionality. I have found that the settings below give
the most functionality without breakage üëáÔ∏è:</p>
<p><code>Configure -&gt; Network</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set <code>Use all available networks</code> to ON. This enables Wifi and mobile data to
be used at the same time by Rethink. (Optional, may use more battery)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set your IP version</strong>: The default is <code>IPv4</code>, you can choose between
<code>IPv6 (experimental)</code> and <code>Auto (experimental)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the <code>Loopback</code> sounds like a good idea but it makes many of the
resolvers fail. You may have better luck, just remember that this could be
what's causing your connectivity issues if you're having any.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose fallback DNS</strong>: When your user-preferred DNS is not reachable,
fallback DNS will be used. I typically choose RethinkDNS as the fallback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may want to experiment with shutting off <code>Enable network visibility</code>, just
keep in mind that some apps may break. "Shutting this off prevents apps from
accessing all available networks, stopping them from bypassing Rethinks
tunnel". This caused issues with the browser when turned off.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="firewall"><a class="header" href="#firewall">Firewall</a></h3>
<p><code>Configure -&gt; Firewall -&gt; Universal firewall rules</code> and set the following to ON:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Block all apps when device is locked</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Block when DNS is bypassed</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Block port 80 (insecure HTTP) traffic</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get more restrictive from here, but it will take some manual
intervention to get everything working correctly.</p>
<p>Keep your firewall rules in mind when you're configuring per app settings. If
the Universal firewall blocks all apps when the device is locked, do you want
this app affected by this or do you want to let it Bypass the Universal
firewall?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="turn-on-dns-and-firewall"><a class="header" href="#turn-on-dns-and-firewall">Turn ON DNS and Firewall</a></h2>
<p><code>Home</code> üè†:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the big <code>Start</code> button on the bottom of the screen and leave it set to
the default <code>DNS and Firewall (default)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we've started the DNS and Firewall, we can go back to
<code>Configure -&gt; DNS</code> and ensure the provider we chose started successfully. You
can also experiment with different types of resolvers, make sure to wait for
below the chosen resolver to say <code>Connected</code>.</p>
<p>Now, all apps on your device by default allow both Wi-Fi and mobile data access
<strong>through the RethinkDNS encrypted tunnel</strong>. Try some of your most used Apps to
see if they function correctly.</p>
<p>RethinkDNS‚Äôs firewall blocks or restricts any network traffic that isn‚Äôt
explicitly allowed. Although by default all apps are allowed network access,
some apps require special permissions or bypasses due to their network behavior.
Many apps rely on multiple external services, backend APIs, etc. that may be
blocked by the firewall.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="apps-that-dont-work"><a class="header" href="#apps-that-dont-work">Apps that Don't work</a></h3>
<p>I will use Reddit as an example, the process is the same for any app. Reddit‚Äôs
app and website rely on multiple third-party services and external domains
beyond just <code>reddit.com</code> itself.</p>
<p>For apps that don't work it's important to ensure that your Android systems
<code>Private DNS</code> is set to <code>Automatic</code>.</p>
<p><code>Home -&gt; Apps</code>:</p>
<p>Search for <code>Reddit</code>, click on it and the Firewall Rules For Reddit will pop up.
Since it is already allowed <code>Unmetered</code> and <code>Metered</code> connections and still
doesn't work, we can try one setting at a time until it does work and this is
the same process for other Apps that aren't working.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, you should check your logs and see why it's being blocked. Look at the
domains involved and set trust rules for said domains. (start by trusting
reddit.com). Check the logs again, add any domains that were blocked related
to reddit. If it is unclear why networking still isn't working, you can:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Bypass Universal</code>, this allows it to bypass any Universal Firewall rules you
have set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're using Rethink's DNS, you can try allowing the app to
<code>Bypass DNS &amp; Firewall</code>. Try the app again, does it work? If not:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also <code>Isolate</code> an App, you then have to set up <em>trust | allow</em> rules
for domains or IPs over a period of time which can take a while. You can go to
<code>Apps</code> and search for the app in question, click on it and at the bottom of
the screen you'll see <code>IP Logs</code>, and <code>Domain Logs</code> to help with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Exclude</code> the app. This makes RethinkDNS completely unaware of the app and is
often what is required for Reddit. It is my understanding that after you
<code>Exclude</code> Reddit for example, your systems Automatic Secure DNS will pick it
up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="other-methods"><a class="header" href="#other-methods">Other Methods</a></h3>
<p>Rather than watching the logs and setting trust rules over time, you could use
tools like <code>nslookup</code> and <code>dig</code> to resolve said domain and reveal IP ranges
used.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nslookup reddit.com
Server:         127.0.0.1
Address:        127.0.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   reddit.com
Address: 151.101.129.140
Name:   reddit.com
Address: 151.101.193.140
Name:   reddit.com
Address: 151.101.1.140
Name:   reddit.com
Address: 151.101.65.140
Name:   reddit.com
Address: 2a04:4e42::396
Name:   reddit.com
Address: 2a04:4e42:600::396
Name:   reddit.com
Address: 2a04:4e42:200::396
Name:   reddit.com
Address: 2a04:4e42:400::396
</code></pre>
<p>Resolving a domain (like <code>reddit.com</code>) using tools like <code>nslookup</code> or <code>dig</code>
reveals multiple IPs because large services use multiple servers across CDNs and
networks for redundancy and performance.</p>
<p>You can then run <code>whois</code> on one of those IPs (e.g., <code>whois 151.101.129.140</code>) to
identify the subnet ranges owned by Reddit's CDN provider (Fastly in this case),
which helps when setting up subnet range allow rules in Rethink.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Use caution when setting trust rules for subnet ranges, as this grants
access to all services hosted within that range, potentially including
services unrelated to the one you intend to access. Best practice is to first
attempt to trust the specific domain name (e.g., reddit.com), which is
generally the most granular and secure method. Only consider trusting broader
subnet ranges (like 151.101.0.0/16) as a last resort if domain-based rules
fail to resolve connectivity issues for the intended service.</p>

<h3 id="firefox-encrypted-dns-through-rethink"><a class="header" href="#firefox-encrypted-dns-through-rethink">Firefox Encrypted DNS through Rethink</a></h3>
<p>First, make sure you can visit a few sites in Firefox. If you can, then your
browser traffic should be routed through the Rethink tunnel, we will check here.
If you can't, go to <code>Home -&gt; Apps</code> and search for Firefox, is networking
enabled?</p>
<p><strong>RethinkDNS Settings</strong></p>
<p>For the best experience routing your browser traffic through your custom
endpoint (e.g., DNSCrypt) on both Wi-Fi and mobile data ensure the following are
set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not turn on <code>Block any app not in use</code> in the Universal firewall. After
some Log digging, I found that this causes the browser to fail more often than
not.</li>
<li><code>Configure -&gt; Network -&gt; Enable network visibility</code> set to ON. I had
experimented with turning this off and certain websites wouldn't load when on
Wi-Fi and none would load on mobile data. Turning it back on seemed to fix
both with no leaks detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Double check that in Rethink's <code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; Prevent DNS leaks</code> is ON, as
well as the Universal Firewalls <code>Block when DNS is bypassed</code> ON.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Firefox Settings</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Firefox, plug <code>about:config</code> into the URL bar and scroll down to
<code>network.ttr.mode</code> and change its value to <code>3</code> to prevent leaking DNS queries
to the System resolver. Also in <code>about:config</code> scroll down to
<code>media.peerconnection.enabled</code>, double-click to set it to false to prevent
WebRTC leaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The trade-off is that disabling WebRTC also disables any websites or apps
using WebRTC for real-time communication (like video calls or chat functions)
from working correctly.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">Wikipedia WebRTC</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In Firefox <code>Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security</code>, set <code>DNS over HTTPS</code> to
<code>Default Protection</code>, this enables Firefox to use RethinkDNS's DNSCrypt resolver
or whatever you chose.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Checking for DNS Leaks</strong></p>
<p>Go to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">https://dnsleaktest.com
</code></pre>
<p>Also crosscheck with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">https://ipleak.net
</code></pre>
<p><code>ipleak.net</code> may show many more servers but as long as they are all related to
your resolver (i.e., WoodyNet for Quad9) you are not leaking to your ISP or
other third-parties.</p>
<p>For DNSCrypt with Quad9 Security, <code>dnsleaktest</code> found 5 servers all with the ISP
<code>WoodyNet</code> indicating success through Quad9. Quad9 relies on Packet Clearing
House, that's where the <code>WoodyNet</code> name comes from.</p>
<p>When on mobile data, when going to <code>https://dnsleaktest.com</code> the results may
show more servers. As long as they are all the same ISP you're good.</p>
<p>A different solution could be to experiment with more strict RethinkDNS settings
and just use the browsers built-in DNS over HTTPS on max protection. Having more
strict defaults for Rethink with all of your apps and configuring your browser
separate may be a better option, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>When hunting down a solution you can go to <code>Configure -&gt; Logs</code>, then try to
visit the site that wouldn't work while watching the logs. You should see
<code>Firefox</code> pop up, click it, in the top right of the pop up should be the reason
it was blocked.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="duckduckgo"><a class="header" href="#duckduckgo"><a href="#duckduckgo">DuckDuckGo</a></a></h3>
<p>I also tested DuckDuckGo with its stock configuration and <code>dnsleaktest.com</code>
showed that DDGs traffic was successfully tunneled through Rethink to Quad9s'
servers.</p>
<p><code>dnsleaktest.com</code> showed all <code>WoodyNet</code> ISPs indicating success.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="chromium-based-browsers-brave"><a class="header" href="#chromium-based-browsers-brave"><a href="#chromium-based-browsers-brave">Chromium Based Browsers (Brave)</a></a></h4>
<p>Brave would not work when routed through Rethink and Chrome completely ignored
it. Brave is definitely better if you must use a Chrome derivative.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I tried disabling the Brave Shield <code>Use Secure DNS</code> to see if that helped, it
didn't. There may be more you could do here to get it working...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do have Chrome and google apps disabled on my main device and only active in
the Secure Folder which is like a sandboxed environment. This could very well
be the reason it ignored Rethink, I don't care to test further...</p>

<summary> ‚úîÔ∏è Click to Expand Android Privacy Tips for the paranoid </summary>
<p>If you don't like the idea of someone forcing you to unlock your phone so they
can sift through your data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's often recommended to <strong>not</strong> use biometrics as they can be forcibly be
taken from you while a password typically can't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellebrite">Cellebrite</a> relies on your phone
being in AFU mode which is After first unlock.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BFU</strong>: Before First Unlock. This refers to the state right after a device
restarts. Since you haven't entered your password yet, the system has not
unlocked the phone's storage, so its contents remain encrypted.</p>
<p><strong>AFU</strong>: After First Unlock. In this state, the device has been unlocked at
least once since it was powered on, even if it is currently locked. The
encryption keys are loaded into RAM, making the device's stored data more
accessible and increasing the potential attack surface compared to the BFU
state.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set the Auto optimization (Auto Restart) to the shortest amount of time
possible. When your phone first reboots it is in BFU mode which is Before
first unlock mode. Biometrics are usually disabled in this mode and the
encryption keys are <strong>not</strong> saved in RAM making the attack surface much
smaller.(i.e., they typically have to guess the password or brute-force it)</p>
<ul>
<li>That said, if someone gets your phone while it's in AFU mode they will only
have the amount of time until your next auto reboot to try to extract your
data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also try to reduce the number of unlock attempts before the device
wipes. The default is typically 20 attempts, I haven't found a way to lower
this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can't really trust Airplane mode on anything but GrapheneOS. If you are
able to remove your battery, do that when it matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your <code>About phone</code> section, name your device something that doesn't expose
anything useful about yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set a pin for your phones sim card to prevent sim swaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider something like mint mobile or visible, they often let you register
with only a spoofed email address.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bluetooth is inherently insecure and broadcasts information about your device
constantly. Walmart and other stores have started using Bluetooth to see hot
zones to strategically place adds on the most traveled areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.edgescan.com/bluetooth-and-the-invisible-security-threat-youre-probably-not-listening-to/">Bluetooth the invisible threat</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Turn off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Location, Nearby device scanning, etc. when not in
use or needed. Your weather app doesn't need your location 24/7, find one that
lets you manually enter your location and time zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a password manager rather than using the one built into the browser, I

<p><strong>F-Droid</strong></p>
<p>F-Droid is a free and open-source app store for Android that only distributes
open-source software, without ads, proprietary code, or user tracking. All apps
are vetted for privacy and transparency, making it a strong alternative to
Google Play.</p>
<p>No registration or account is required, further protecting privacy.</p>
<p>Google restricts apps that remove Google services or modify their core features
to disable their data collection strategies. This is why you won't find many
privacy by default browsers in Google Play. Browsers like IronFox and Cromite
are solid options that disable telemetry and more that are available outside of
the Play ecosystem.</p>
<p>I personally use IronFox as my default and have been happy with it so far. It
comes with uBlock installed by default which I recommend that you learn how to
get the most out of. With Firefox fingerprint protection, a few about:config
tweaks, and uBlock you can accomplish what used to take 6 extensions to do. See:
<a href="#ublock-origin">uBlock Origin</a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>SearXNG</strong></p>
<p>While we're on the topic of browsers, it's worth considering a privacy-focused
metasearch engine like SearXNG. SearXNG anonymizes your search queries and
removes any identifying data before passing them along to Google or other search
engines. This way, you can receive top-quality search results while keeping your
privacy intact</p>
<p>To get started find a few <a href="https://searx.space/">local instances</a> and
<a href="https://searx.neocities.org/nojs.html">others</a> and either bookmark them for
quick access or do what I do and add them to use as your default search engine.</p>
<p>In Firefox go to <code>about:preferences#search</code>, scroll to the bottom and click
<code>Add</code>. Name it whatever you want and for the URL add one of the local instances
followed by <code>search?q=%s</code> for example, for an instance in the US with A+
ratings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">https://searx.ankha.ac/search?q=%s
</code></pre>
<p>Then click <code>Add Engine</code>, and back near the top of the page you can set one
instance as your default search engine and another for private windows. I have
had a good experience so far using SearXNG with the occasional problem that is
solved by using a different instance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ùóÔ∏è Note: When using a public SearXNG instance from someone you don‚Äôt know, you
are trusting the operator since they can see the IP address making the
searches and might keep logs. The site https://searx.space/ provides helpful
details to choose instances based on trust and location. If you want the
highest level of privacy and full control, running your own instance is the
best option‚Äîthough it requires more setup. Using public instances is a great
way to get started and improve privacy compared to regular search engines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Browser compartmentalization</strong> is a technique where you use multiple browsers
to separate different types of online activities. Instead of doing all browsing
in a single browser, you dedicate specific browsers to distinct tasks, for
example, one browser for email and banking, another for social media, and a
third for casual web surfing. This separation makes it difficult for websites
and trackers to link your activities across different contexts because cookies,
trackers, and browsing data are isolated within each browser.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI and social media Apps often require extensive permissions and deep access
to your device data and can run background processes that you can't easily
monitor. If you avoid the apps and only access AI and social media in your
browser you get the benefits of browser sandboxing, tracking prevention,
cookie controls and more. You gain more benefits by using the
compartmentalization technique explained above, possibly one for AI and one
for social media.</li>

</ul>
<p>The post suggests you go to <code>Home -&gt; Apps</code> and right under <code>Showing all apps</code>
click on the grayed out üõúüì∂ to set a rule to <strong>block both Metered and Unmetered
connections to all apps by default</strong>. This will block both Wi-Fi and mobile data
connections to <strong>all apps</strong> on your device.</p>
<p>The point here is that not every App on your device needs network access all the
time or at all in some cases.</p>
<p>Search for the apps you use/trust and:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>start by enabling Wi-Fi üõú and mobile-data üì∂ as well as Bypass Universal so
your required apps aren't blocked right when the screen shuts off or affected
by the firewall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, check your logs and see why it's being blocked. Look at the domains
involved and set trust rules for said domains. If it is unclear why networking
still isn't working, you can:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're using Rethink's DNS, you can try allowing the app to
<code>Bypass DNS &amp; Firewall</code>. Try the app again, does it work? If not:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also <code>Isolate</code> an App, you then have to set up <em>trust | allow</em> rules
for domains or IPs over a period of time which can take a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Exclude</code> the app. This makes RethinkDNS completely unaware of the app and is
often what is required for Reddit. It is my understanding that after you
<code>Exclude</code> an App, your systems Automatic Secure DNS will pick it up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A few apps that typically need network access on Android:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Google Play services (<code>com.google.android.gms</code>): push notifications, safety
checks, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Play Store (<code>com.android.vending</code>) app updates and downloads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Android System (usually UID 1000, often <code>android</code> or <code>system</code>): Core OS
connectivity checks, NTP time sync, and network management. Blocking can cause
"no internet" errors.</p>

<h3 id="tor"><a class="header" href="#tor"><a href="#tor">Tor</a></a></h3>
<p>Tor itself is a network and software that anonymizes traffic by encrypting it
and bouncing it though a series of volunteer-operated relays around the world
before reaching the destination. Orbot uses this Tor network to encrypt and
anonymize internet traffic for Android apps.</p>
<p>Orbot routes app traffic through Tor but doesn't provide the same kind of
traffic isolation and sandboxing that Tor browser offers on desktop. Be aware of
the limitations and use Tor Browser on a hardened system or specialized software
such as Tails or Whonix when anonymity truly matters.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how Tor works, I suggest reading the following in this
order:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ùóÔ∏è WARNING: Tor gets much of its funding from the US government and is not
immune to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.Tor Browser is <strong>not</strong> the most
secure browser, anonymity and security can often be at odds with each other.
Having the exact same browser as many other people isn't the best security
practice, but it is great for anonymity. Tor is also based on Firefox Esr,
which only receives patches for vulnerabilities considered Critical or High
which can be taken advantage of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tor Project has also done some sketchy/questionable things lately such as
removing user agent spoofing which made every user appear as if they were using
the same version of Windows. This decision reduces anonymity and is questionable
at best, seems to me there ought to be a very good reason for doing this which I
can't find. Tor is still one of the best anonymity solutions, just stay informed
and cautious.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of some of the Tor Overview, all credit goes to them.
It is important to spread the word when you can!</p>
<p>If you are fortunate to live outside of oppressive regimes with extreme
censorship, using Tor for every day, mundane activities is likely safe and won‚Äôt
put you on any harmful ‚Äúlist.‚Äù Even if it did, you'd be in good company, these
lists mostly contain great people working tirelessly to defend human rights and
online privacy worldwide.</p>
<p>By using Tor regularly for ordinary browsing, you help strengthen the network,
making it more robust and anonymous for everyone. This collective support makes
staying private easier for activists, journalists, and anyone facing online
surveillance or censorship. The writer of the PrivacyGuides article mentions
using Tor when he needs to access Google Maps to protect his privacy</p>
<p>So, consider embracing Tor not only for sensitive browsing but also for daily
routine tasks. Every user adds valuable noise to the network, helping protect
privacy and freedom for all.</p>

<p><img src="../images/orbot.png" alt="Orbot Logo" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Helpful guide, <a href="https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-orbot/">What is Orbot?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>TCP-Only Proxies forward all TCP-level connections from selected apps to Orbot.</p>
<p>TCP-Only Proxies work best for Apps that use multiple TCP protocols beyond just
basic web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) like messaging apps (Signal), search apps (DDG),
etc. Because it proxies all TCP traffic, it can cause some apps to slow down or
break if they expect direct DNS or UDP.</p>
<p>First install Orbot, Open <code>Orbot -&gt; More -&gt; Orbot Settings</code> and turn on
<code>Power User Mode</code>. <strong>This is important</strong>, if you forget this Rethinks auto Orbot
will not let you choose between SOCKS and HTTP proxies.</p>
<p>You should also check <code>Allow Background Starts</code> ON.</p>
<p>In <code>Configure -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Setup Orbot</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click <code>Add / Remove 0 apps</code>, search for an app that you want to run through
Orbot. For simple testing I chose DuckDuckGo with a TCP-only Proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>Home -&gt; Apps</code> search for <code>Orbot</code> and set <code>Orbot -&gt; Bypass Universal</code> ON</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the first time starting Orbot through Rethink, you'll have to click the
<code>Configure -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Setup Orbot -&gt; Orbot&gt;</code> to <code>Connect</code> as well as grant
initial permissions. After you start Orbot successfully, check out Rethinks
<code>Home</code> and below the STOP button should say <code>Protected With Tor</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Open DuckDuckGo and go to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">https://dnsleaktest.com
# CrossCheck
https://ipcheck.net
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ùó You may see that ipleaktest initially shows a Tor exit relay location such
as the Netherlands, once you complete a Standard Test, it still shows WoodyNet
ISPs. Since I configured Rethink to use DNSCrypt with Quad9 this is completely
expected. This confirms that my DNS traffic is not leaking to my ISP and is
properly anonymized through Tor and Quad9. As long as you don't see your
actual ISP's servers in the results, your setup is working as intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you can add more apps that would benefit from anonymity such as FairMail,
RSS feeds, and crypto wallets. I believe for Signal, it requires that you to set
up the SOCKS5 proxy to work correctly which is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Look into an RSS Feed, they give you complete control of the content you
consume, no algorithm involved!</p>
<p>This can also be useful on public Wi-Fi or other insecure networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can also open Orbot and <code>Choose How to Connect</code>, if you want to hide Tor
use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you live in an area where Tor use isn't discriminated against, consider
Activating your Orbot <code>Kindness</code> tab so others that are in oppressive regimes
can use your device as a bridge. This is a great way to give back!</p>

<p>If you have Orbot set up through auto mode, you'll have to disable it.</p>
<p>Open <code>Orbot -&gt; More</code>: Near the bottom of the screen you'll see <code>HTTP: 8118</code>, and
<code>SOCKS: 9050</code>, these are the Port numbers. We will compare these to Rethinks
defaults. (They match).</p>
<p>Back in Rethink, <code>Configure -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Setup SOCKS5 Proxy</code>.</p>
<p>In the App dropdown choose <code>Orbot</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hostname: <code>127.0.0.1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Port Number: <code>9050</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the rest of the defaults and Hit <code>Set</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go <code>Home</code>, below the STOP button you should see <code>Protected With SOCKS Proxy</code>.
Now all of your devices traffic that doesn't bypass Rethink is routed through
the SOCKS5 proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>Configure -&gt; DNS</code> and turn <code>Never proxy DNS</code> ON</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open your browser and visit <code>https://dnsleaktest.com</code>, your public IP should
no longer be your ISPs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOCKS5 alone doesn't encrypt the traffic; it only proxies or routes it. Orbot
uses SOCKS5 to let apps route traffic into the Tor network. Once inside the
Tor network, the traffic is encrypted in layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a misconception that Orbot is a "free VPN". It‚Äôs actually part of an
anonymity network designed to hide your identity by sending your traffic
through multiple servers. And the SOCKS5 proxy that Orbot uses isn‚Äôt a VPN
either, it simply directs certain app traffic through a proxy server without
creating a full encrypted tunnel from your device like a VPN does.</p>

<h2 id="wireguardvpn"><a class="header" href="#wireguardvpn">WireGuard/VPN</a></h2>
<p><code>Configure -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Setup WireGuard -&gt; +</code>:</p>
<p>With the WireGuard protocol, the provider usually gives you either a QR Code, or
a configuration file (e.g., <code>.conf</code> file) which is a plaintext file that
contains what is needed. You download that file and Click <code>IMPORT</code> which brings
up your phones filesystem.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <code>CREATE</code> option for advanced users who are setting up their
own WireGuard network, typically if you host your own VPN server.</p>
<p>After this is setup you should always verify that your traffic is encrypted
(hidden IP) and your DNS queries are protected (no leaks).</p>
<p>You could:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First check what your IP address is before enabling WireGuard at
<code>whatismyipaddress.com</code> or <code>ipleak.net</code>, take note of your Public IP, ISP,
and City/Country this is your real info that the VPN needs to hide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect to your Wireguard/VPN server. Choose the server location you want and
go back to check again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check for leaks, go to <code>dnsleaktest.com</code> and run a Standard test. If you
don't see your Public IP listed anywhere, you don't have a leak.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3 id="logs"><a class="header" href="#logs"><a href="#logs">Logs</a></a></h3>
<p>On-device logging is on by default. You can find it in <code>Configure -&gt; Settings</code>.
From there, you can set the log level and choose a notification action.</p>
<p>If anyone else uses your phone, it's probably a good idea to enable app lock.</p>
<p>Go to <code>Configure -&gt; Logs</code>, and try to access the app that's not working. You
should see said app at the top of the Network Logs, click it. In the top right
of the tab, you'll see the reason why it's not working such as: <code>App Blocked</code>,
or <code>DNS Bypass</code>.</p>
<p>This <code>DNS Bypass</code> means that the App in question is trying to bypass the Rethink
Tunnel and being actively blocked. You can search for said app and try setting
IP or Port Trust rules.</p>
<p>You can also go to <code>Home -&gt; Apps</code> and search for the App you need, click on it
and at the bottom of the screen you will see <code>IP Logs</code>, and <code>Domain Logs</code>.</p>
<p>Once you click on the log of the app in question, you'll be given 3 drop down
options. If you set an app to Bypass DNS and Firewall settings, you will see
that in the first dropdown box.</p>
<p>The next drop down is <code>Block,trust this IP for this app</code> where you can set a
rule to <code>Block</code> or <code>Trust</code>.</p>
