IP operates at the network\nlayer and does not guarantee delivery order or error checking, which is\nhandled by TCP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>IP Address</strong> (Internet Protocol Address): A unique numeric label assigned to\neach device on a network, used to identify and locate the device for\ncommunication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Subnet</strong> (Subnet Range): represents a block of IP addresses grouped together\nunder a single rule. Instead of allowing or blocking individual IP addresses\none by one, you define a subnet to include a wide range of IPs within that\nblock.(Useful for apps that you <code>Isolate</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Host</strong>: Any device connected to a network with an IP address, capable of\nsending and receiving data, including computers, phones, or servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Client</strong>: A device or software (often your computer or phone) that initiates\nrequests to servers to access resources or services, forming the client-server\nmodel of communication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Port</strong>: A port in networking is a virtual communication endpoint managed by\na computer’s operating system that helps direct network traffic to specific\napps or services. While an IP address identifies a device on a network, ports\nallow the system to know exactly which app or service should handle the\nincoming or outgoing data. Web traffic commonly uses port 80 (HTTP) or 443\n(HTTPS), so when data arrives for those ports, it’s routed to the web server\napplication on the device. When we block port 80, we block insecure HTTP\nconnections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) is responsible for maintaining a\nconnection through a handshake and putting the packets in the correct order.\nTCP will also ask for missing pieces and is known as a reliable but slow\nprotocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UDP</strong> (User Datagram Protocol) (UDP/IP): is a fast protocol used across the\ninternet for time-sensitive transmissions such as DNS lookups or VoIP. UDP\nallows a computer to send data straight to another without requiring a\nhandshake.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DNS</strong> (Domain Name System): stores domain information in a distributed\ndatabase and translates domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. This\nenables us to only have to remember simple domain names rather than complex IP\naddresses.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Domain Name</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">ssd.eff.org\n |   |   |\n |   |  top-level domain\n |   |\n |   second-level domain\n |\nsubdomain\n</code></pre>\n<p>☝️ The hierarchy is read from right to left, the TLD is the highest-level\ndomain (<code>.org</code> here), the second-level domain (<code>eff</code>) is directly to the left\nof the TLD, and anything further left (like <code>ssd</code>) is a subdomain under that\nsecond-level domain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DNS Server</strong>: When you search for a domain name (rethinkdns.com) it triggers\na DNS lookup. Several different types of DNS servers typically work together\nto complete a single DNS lookup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DNS Resolver</strong>: is a server or software component that translates domain\nnames into IP addresses that devices use to communicate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unicast DNS</strong>: The traditional DNS setup where each DNS server is assigned a\nunique, single IP address. DNS queries from clients are directed to this\nspecific server regardless of the clients location.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Anycast DNS</strong>: Anycast allows a single IP address to be used by multiple\nservers. In Anycast DNS, a DNS query can be answered by any one of several DNS\nservers, usually the one closest to the user by geographic or network\nproximity. This setup reduces latency, increases the availability of DNS\nresolution services, and offers protection against DNS flood DDoS attacks by\ndistributing traffic across multiple servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Recursive resolver</strong> (DNS recursor): is typically the first stop in the\nseries of the above servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Iterative resolver</strong>: In an iterative DNS query, each DNS server responds\ndirectly to the client with a referral to another server, and the client\ncontinues querying successive servers until it receives the IP address for the\nrequested domain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proxy</strong>: A proxy, in relation to Orbot with Rethink, is an intermediary\nservice that routes internet traffic from your device through the Tor network\nto provide privacy and anonymity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>HTTP(S) Proxy</strong>: An HTTP proxy is an intermediary server that forwards\nHTTP/HTTPS web traffic from a client (e.g., a browser or app) to destination\nservers, allowing for privacy, filtering, or routing control while masking the\nuser’s IP. HTTP proxies only work with web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SOCKS5</strong> (Socket Secure 5): Is an internet proxy protocol that transfers\ninfo from one server to another while redirecting the user’s IP address. It\nsupports both UDP and TCP and can actually improve speed in some cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole\">pi-hole</a>: a DNS sinkhole that protects\nyour devices content without installing any client-side software.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/evilsocket/opensnitch\">OpenSnitch</a>: is a GNU/Linux\napplication firewall.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>proxifier</em>: a proxifier acts as a proxy client, routing specific application\ntraffic through proxy servers without encrypting data or providing global IP\nmasking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>VPN</em> (Virtual Private Network): a VPN creates an encrypted tunnel that routes\nall network traffic from your device through a remote server, masking your IP\naddress and securing your entire connection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WireGuard: a modern VPN encryption protocol, its fast and has gained\nwidespread adoption among VPN providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OpenVPN: an older, more mature VPN protocol that uses SSL/TLS for encryption.\nIt’s known for being very reliable and highly configurable but tends to be\nslower and more complex than WireGuard. Good VPNs often give you the choice\nbetween protocols.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Bypass DNS and Firewall</code>: Bypass the DNS and Firewall for this app, <strong>this\nonly works with Rethink’s DNS</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Bypass Universal</code>: Bypass the Universal firewall for this app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Exclude</code>: The app is excluded from the dns and firewall, Rethink is unaware\nof this app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Isolate</code>: When an app is isolated, only trusted IPs are allowed.

Network and web sites can fingerprint and track users\nbased on non-default DNS configurations.\n–<a href=\"https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-dns\">grapheneos default-dns</a></p>\n<p>Given that it is a fact that many ISPs are known to share this data and do other\nprivacy disrespecting things, I would personally rather make it harder for them.\nI included this because they are the experts and the choice is yours, I use a\ncustom DNS myself. I guess since so many people virtue-signal saying that they\n“have nothing to hide”(a reckless, privileged notion) that not many people truly\ncare about privacy and are likely using the default. The more people that we can\nconvince to use privacy respecting tools, the better it is for everybody.</p>\n<p>Recommended Resolvers:</p>\n<details>\n<summary> ✔️ Click to Expand recommended resolvers </summary>\n<p>These are just the providers I’ve researched personally and not in a specific\norder.

Do some research, whats their business model, privacy policy, etc.\nUnfortunately, with a VPN you are also just shifting the trust.

It\nensures apps that proxy DNS/HTTP/SOCKS traffic don’t leak outside the VPN.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do not route Private IPs</strong>: Prevents routing traffic destined for private IP\naddress ranges (like 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) through the tunnel. Instead, this\ntraffic goes directly over the local network or system default route. Most\nuseful when you want devices on your local network (NAS, printers, etc.) to be\nreachable by apps on your phone without routing the traffic through Rethinks\ntunnel, improving performance and reliability of local connections but\npossibly reducing privacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Loopback (experimental)</strong>: When enabled, this routes RethinkDNS’s own\ninternal traffic, such as blocklist downloads, connectivity checks, and DNS\nqueries made by the app itself, back into the encrypted tunnel through the\nloopback device.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Setting</th><th>Function</th><th>When to Use</th></tr></thead><tbody>\n<tr><td>Loopback Proxy Forwarder Apps</td><td>Route proxy-forwarder app traffic back into Rethink VPN tunnel</td><td>When you want consistent VPN/privacy coverage for proxies</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Do Not Route Private IPs</td><td>Avoid routing local network/private IP traffic through VPN (send directly)</td><td>To access local devices without VPN bottlenecks</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Loopback (Experimental)</td><td>Route Rethink’s own app traffic (updates/checks) back through VPN tunnel</td><td>To fully protect app’s own DNS/blocklist traffic</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>NOTE: The above settings are disabled by default because some are experimental\nand can easily break functionality.

This enables Wifi and mobile data to\nbe used at the same time by Rethink.

Although by default all apps are allowed network access,\nsome apps require special permissions or bypasses due to their network behavior.\nMany apps rely on multiple external services, backend APIs, etc. that may be\nblocked by the firewall.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Apps that Don’t work</h3>\n<p>I will use Reddit as an example, the process is the same for any app. Reddit’s\napp and website rely on multiple third-party services and external domains\nbeyond just <code>reddit.com</code> itself.</p>\n<p>For apps that don’t work it’s important to ensure that your Android systems\n<code>Private DNS</code> is set to <code>Automatic</code>.</p>\n<p><code>Home -&gt; Apps</code>:</p>\n<p>Search for <code>Reddit</code>, click on it and the Firewall Rules For Reddit will pop up.\nSince it is already allowed <code>Unmetered</code> and <code>Metered</code> connections and still\ndoesn’t work, we can try one setting at a time until it does work and this is\nthe same process for other Apps that aren’t working.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First, you should check your logs and see why it’s being blocked. Look at the\ndomains involved and set trust rules for said domains. (start by trusting\nreddit.com). Check the logs again, add any domains that were blocked related\nto reddit. If it is unclear why networking still isn’t working, you can:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Bypass Universal</code>, this allows it to bypass any Universal Firewall rules you\nhave set.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’re using Rethink’s DNS, you can try allowing the app to\n<code>Bypass DNS &amp; Firewall</code>. Try the app again, does it work? If not:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can also <code>Isolate</code> an App, you then have to set up <em>trust | allow</em> rules\nfor domains or IPs over a period of time which can take a while. You can go to\n<code>Apps</code> and search for the app in question, click on it and at the bottom of\nthe screen you’ll see <code>IP Logs</code>, and <code>Domain Logs</code> to help with this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Exclude</code> the app. This makes RethinkDNS completely unaware of the app and is\noften what is required for Reddit. It is my understanding that after you\n<code>Exclude</code> Reddit for example, your systems Automatic Secure DNS will pick it\nup.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>Other Methods</h3>\n<p>Rather than watching the logs and setting trust rules over time, you could use\ntools like <code>nslookup</code> and <code>dig</code> to resolve said domain and reveal IP ranges\nused.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">nslookup reddit.com\nServer:         127.0.0.1\nAddress:        127.0.0.1#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   reddit.com\nAddress: 151.101.129.140\nName:   reddit.com\nAddress: 151.101.193.140\nName:   reddit.com\nAddress: 151.101.1.140\nName:   reddit.com\nAddress: 151.101.65.140\nName:   reddit.com\nAddress: 2a04:4e42::396\nName:   reddit.com\nAddress: 2a04:4e42:600::396\nName:   reddit.com\nAddress: 2a04:4e42:200::396\nName:   reddit.com\nAddress: 2a04:4e42:400::396\n</code></pre>\n<p>Resolving a domain (like <code>reddit.com</code>) using tools like <code>nslookup</code> or <code>dig</code>\nreveals multiple IPs because large services use multiple servers across CDNs and\nnetworks for redundancy and performance.</p>\n<p>You can then run <code>whois</code> on one of those IPs (e.g., <code>whois 151.101.129.140</code>) to\nidentify the subnet ranges owned by Reddit’s CDN provider (Fastly in this case),\nwhich helps when setting up subnet range allow rules in Rethink.</p>\n<details>\n<summary> ✔️ Click to Expand `whois` Example Output </summary>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">whois 151.101.129.140\n\n#\n# ARIN WHOIS data and services are subject to the Terms of Use\n# available at: https://www.arin.net/resources/registry/whois/tou/\n#\n# If you see inaccuracies in the results, please report at\n# https://www.arin.net/resources/registry/whois/inaccuracy_reporting/\n#\n# Copyright 1997-2025, American Registry for Internet Numbers, Ltd.\n#\n\n\nNetRange:       151.101.0.0 - 151.101.255.255\nCIDR:           151.101.0.0/16\nNetName:        SKYCA-3\nNetHandle:      NET-151-101-0-0-1\nParent:         RIPE-ERX-151 (NET-151-0-0-0-0)\nNetType:        Direct Allocation\nOriginAS:\nOrganization:   Fastly, Inc.

If you can, then your\nbrowser traffic should be routed through the Rethink tunnel, we will check here.\nIf you can’t, go to <code>Home -&gt; Apps</code> and search for Firefox, is networking\nenabled?</p>\n<p><strong>RethinkDNS Settings</strong></p>\n<p>For the best experience routing your browser traffic through your custom\nendpoint (e.g., DNSCrypt) on both Wi-Fi and mobile data ensure the following are\nset:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not turn on <code>Block any app not in use</code> in the Universal firewall. After\nsome Log digging, I found that this causes the browser to fail more often than\nnot.</li>\n<li><code>Configure -&gt; Network -&gt; Enable network visibility</code> set to ON. I had\nexperimented with turning this off and certain websites wouldn’t load when on\nWi-Fi and none would load on mobile data. Turning it back on seemed to fix\nboth with no leaks detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Double check that in Rethink’s <code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; Prevent DNS leaks</code> is ON, as\nwell as the Universal Firewalls <code>Block when DNS is bypassed</code> ON.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Firefox Settings</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Firefox, plug <code>about:config</code> into the URL bar and scroll down to\n<code>network.trr.mode</code> and change its value to <code>3</code> to prevent leaking DNS queries\nto the System resolver. Also in <code>about:config</code> scroll down to\n<code>media.peerconnection.enabled</code>, double-click to set it to false to prevent\nWebRTC leaks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IronFox no longer lets you adjust the <code>network.trr.mode</code> in <code>about:config</code>, you\nadjust the <code>trr.mode</code> through the DNS over HTTPS settings. Set it to\n<code>Default Protection</code> or <code>OFF</code> and check for dns leaks. Fennec also has issues\nwith setting <code>network.trr.mode 3</code> and falls back to insecure methods. I would\nsuggest using the built in DNS over HTTPS for Fennec on max protection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The trade-off is that disabling WebRTC also disables any websites or apps\nusing WebRTC for real-time communication (like video calls or chat functions)\nfrom working correctly.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC\">Wikipedia WebRTC</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Firefox <code>Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security</code>, set <code>DNS over HTTPS</code> to\n<code>Default Protection</code> or <code>OFF</code>, this enables Firefox to use RethinkDNS’s DNSCrypt\nresolver or whatever you chose.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Checking for DNS Leaks</strong></p>\n<p>Go to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">https://dnsleaktest.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also crosscheck with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">https://ipleak.net\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>ipleak.net</code> may show many more servers but as long as they are all related to\nyour resolver (i.e., WoodyNet for Quad9) you are not leaking to your ISP or\nother third-parties.</p>\n<p>For DNSCrypt with Quad9 Security, <code>dnsleaktest</code> found 5 servers all with the ISP\n<code>WoodyNet</code> indicating success through Quad9. Quad9 relies on Packet Clearing\nHouse, that’s where the <code>WoodyNet</code> name comes from.</p>\n<p>When on mobile data, when going to <code>https://dnsleaktest.com</code> the results may\nshow more servers.

This refers to the state right after a device\nrestarts. Since you haven’t entered your password yet, the system has not\nunlocked the phone’s storage, so its contents remain encrypted.</p>\n<p><strong>AFU</strong>: After First Unlock. In this state, the device has been unlocked at\nleast once since it was powered on, even if it is currently locked. The\nencryption keys are loaded into RAM, making the device’s stored data more\naccessible and increasing the potential attack surface compared to the BFU\nstate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Set the Auto optimization (Auto Restart) to the shortest amount of time\npossible. When your phone first reboots it is in BFU mode which is Before\nfirst unlock mode. Biometrics are usually disabled in this mode and the\nencryption keys are <strong>not</strong> saved in RAM making the attack surface much\nsmaller.(i.e., they typically have to guess the password or brute-force it)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That said, if someone gets your phone while it’s in AFU mode they will only\nhave the amount of time until your next auto reboot to try to extract your\ndata.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can also try to reduce the number of unlock attempts before the device\nwipes. The default is typically 20 attempts, I haven’t found a way to lower\nthis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can’t really trust Airplane mode on anything but GrapheneOS.

SearXNG anonymizes your search queries and\nremoves any identifying data before passing them along to Google or other search\nengines. This way, you can receive top-quality search results while keeping your\nprivacy intact</p>\n<p>To get started find a few <a href=\"https://searx.space/\">local instances</a> and\n<a href=\"https://searx.neocities.org/nojs.html\">others</a> and either bookmark them for\nquick access or do what I do and add them to use as your default search engine.</p>\n<p>In Firefox go to <code>about:preferences#search</code>, scroll to the bottom and click\n<code>Add</code>. Name it whatever you want and for the URL add one of the local instances\nfollowed by <code>search?q=%s</code> for example, for an instance in the US with A+\nratings:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">https://searx.ankha.ac/search?q=%s\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then click <code>Add Engine</code>, and back near the top of the page you can set one\ninstance as your default search engine and another for private windows. I have\nhad a good experience so far using SearXNG with the occasional problem that is\nsolved by using a different instance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>❗️ Note: When using a public SearXNG instance from someone you don’t know, you\nare trusting the operator since they can see the IP address making the\nsearches and might keep logs. The site https://searx.space/ provides helpful\ndetails to choose instances based on trust and location. If you want the\nhighest level of privacy and full control, running your own instance is the\nbest option—though it requires more setup. Using public instances is a great\nway to get started and improve privacy compared to regular search engines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Browser compartmentalization</strong> is a technique where you use multiple browsers\nto separate different types of online activities. Instead of doing all browsing\nin a single browser, you dedicate specific browsers to distinct tasks, for\nexample, one browser for email and banking, another for social media, and a\nthird for casual web surfing.

Orbot uses this Tor network to encrypt and\nanonymize internet traffic for Android apps.</p>\n<p>Orbot routes app traffic through Tor but doesn’t provide the same kind of\ntraffic isolation and sandboxing that Tor browser offers on desktop. Be aware of\nthe limitations and use Tor Browser on a hardened system or specialized software\nsuch as Tails or Whonix when anonymity truly matters.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn how Tor works, I suggest reading the following in this\norder:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/04/30/in-praise-of-tor/\">PrivacyGuides In Praise of Tor</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/advanced/tor-overview/\">PrivacyGuides Tor Overview</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-use-tor\">EFF How to: Use Tor</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Tor is at risk, and needs our help</strong>. Despite its strength and history, Tor\nisn’t safe from the same attacks oppressive regimes and misinformed legislators\ndirect at encryption and many other privacy-enhancing\ntechnologies.–<a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/04/30/in-praise-of-tor/#how-to-support-tor\">How to Support Tor</a></p>\n<details>\n<summary>\n✔️ Click to Expand Tor Section\n</summary>\n<blockquote>\n<p>❗️ WARNING: Tor gets much of its funding from the US government and is not\nimmune to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.Tor Browser is <strong>not</strong> the most\nsecure browser, anonymity and security can often be at odds with each other.\nHaving the exact same browser as many other people isn’t the best security\npractice, but it is great for anonymity. Tor is also based on Firefox Esr,\nwhich only receives patches for vulnerabilities considered Critical or High\nwhich can be taken advantage of.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tor Project has also done some sketchy/questionable things lately such as\nremoving user agent spoofing which made every user appear as if they were using\nthe same version of Windows. This decision reduces anonymity and is questionable\nat best, seems to me there ought to be a very good reason for doing this which I\ncan’t find. Tor is still one of the best anonymity solutions, just stay informed\nand cautious.</p>\n<p>The following is a summary of some of the Tor Overview, all credit goes to them.\nIt is important to spread the word when you can!</p>\n<p>If you are fortunate to live outside of oppressive regimes with extreme\ncensorship, using Tor for every day, mundane activities is likely safe and won’t\nput you on any harmful “list.” Even if it did, you’d be in good company, these\nlists mostly contain great people working tirelessly to defend human rights and\nonline privacy worldwide.</p>\n<p>By using Tor regularly for ordinary browsing, you help strengthen the network,\nmaking it more robust and anonymous for everyone. This collective support makes\nstaying private easier for activists, journalists, and anyone facing online\nsurveillance or censorship. The writer of the PrivacyGuides article mentions\nusing Tor when he needs to access Google Maps to protect his privacy</p>\n<p>So, consider embracing Tor not only for sensitive browsing but also for daily\nroutine tasks. Every user adds valuable noise to the network, helping protect\nprivacy and freedom for all.</p>\n</details>\n<hr />\n<h3><a href=\"#setting-up-orbot-with-a-tcp-only-proxy\">Setting up Orbot with a TCP-only Proxy</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"../images/orbot.png\" alt=\"Orbot Logo\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helpful guide, <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-orbot/\">What is Orbot?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>TCP-Only Proxies forward all TCP-level connections from selected apps to Orbot.</p>\n<p>TCP-Only Proxies work best for Apps that use multiple TCP protocols beyond just\nbasic web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) like messaging apps (Signal), search apps (DDG),\netc. Because it proxies all TCP traffic, it can cause some apps to slow down or\nbreak if they expect direct DNS or UDP.</p>\n<p>First install Orbot, Open <code>Orbot -&gt; More -&gt; Orbot Settings</code> and turn on\n<code>Power User Mode</code>. <strong>This is important</strong>, if you forget this Rethinks auto Orbot\nwill not let you choose between SOCKS and HTTP proxies.</p>\n<p>You should also check <code>Allow Background Starts</code> ON.</p>\n<p>In <code>Configure -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Setup Orbot</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Click <code>Add / Remove 0 apps</code>, search for an app that you want to run through\nOrbot.

After you start Orbot successfully, check out Rethinks\n<code>Home</code> and below the STOP button should say <code>Protected With Tor</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open DuckDuckGo and go to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">https://dnsleaktest.com\n# CrossCheck\nhttps://ipcheck.net\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>❗ You may see that ipleaktest initially shows a Tor exit relay location such\nas the Netherlands, once you complete a Standard Test, it still shows WoodyNet\nISPs. Since I configured Rethink to use DNSCrypt with Quad9 this is completely\nexpected. This confirms that my DNS traffic is not leaking to my ISP and is\nproperly anonymized through Tor and Quad9. As long as you don’t see your\nactual ISP’s servers in the results, your setup is working as intended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now you can add more apps that would benefit from anonymity such as FairEmail,\nRSS feeds, and crypto wallets. I believe for Signal, it requires that you to set\nup the SOCKS5 proxy to work correctly which is pretty straightforward.</p>\n<p>Look into an RSS Feed, they give you complete control of the content you\nconsume, no algorithm involved!</p>\n<p>This can also be useful on public Wi-Fi or other insecure networks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You can also open Orbot and <code>Choose How to Connect</code>, if you want to hide Tor\nuse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you live in an area where Tor use isn’t discriminated against, consider\nActivating your Orbot <code>Kindness</code> tab so others that are in oppressive regimes\ncan use your device as a bridge.

Orbot\nuses SOCKS5 to let apps route traffic into the Tor network. Once inside the\nTor network, the traffic is encrypted in layers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is a misconception that Orbot is a “free VPN”. It’s actually part of an\nanonymity network designed to hide your identity by sending your traffic\nthrough multiple servers. And the SOCKS5 proxy that Orbot uses isn’t a VPN\neither, it simply directs certain app traffic through a proxy server without\ncreating a full encrypted tunnel from your device like a VPN does.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>WireGuard/VPN</h2>\n<p>Keep your goals in mind before paying for a VPN, some allow you to pay with cash\nanonymously such as Mullvad VPN and a few others. Remember that you are\ntransferring trust, from your ISP to the VPN provider.</p>\n<p><code>Configure -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Setup WireGuard -&gt; +</code>:</p>\n<p>With the WireGuard protocol, the provider usually gives you either a QR Code, or\na configuration file (e.g., <code>.conf</code> file) which is a plaintext file that\ncontains what is needed. You download that file and Click <code>IMPORT</code> which brings\nup your phones filesystem.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the <code>CREATE</code> option for advanced users who are setting up their\nown WireGuard network, typically if you host your own VPN server.</p>\n<p>After this is setup you should always verify that your traffic is encrypted\n(hidden IP) and your DNS queries are protected (no leaks).</p>\n<p>You could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>First check what your IP address is before enabling WireGuard at\n<code>whatismyipaddress.com</code> or <code>ipleak.net</code>, take note of your Public IP, ISP,\nand City/Country this is your real info that the VPN needs to hide.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Connect to your Wireguard/VPN server. Choose the server location you want and\ngo back to check again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check for leaks, go to <code>dnsleaktest.com</code> and run a Standard test. If you\ndon’t see your Public IP listed anywhere, you don’t have a leak.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Fixing DNS Leaks</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use WireGuard in Simple mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Or, use <code>Configure -&gt; DNS -&gt; Split DNS</code> with WireGuard in\n<code>Advanved + Lockdown</code> mode (if running on Android 12+)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To ensure your DNS requests go through your VPN, check\n<code>Configure -&gt; Logs -&gt; DNS</code>.
